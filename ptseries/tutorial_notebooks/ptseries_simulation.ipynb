These options are used to automatically determine which back-end PT Series simulator to use. For instance, the \"single-loop\" simulator is ideally suited for simulating a PT Series with up to 1000 inputs and a single loop, whereas the \"multi-loop\" simulator can handle any number of loops but cannot simulate more than 20 inputs. Check the documentation or the README for the `ptseries.tbi` module to see which backend simulators are currently available.\n",
