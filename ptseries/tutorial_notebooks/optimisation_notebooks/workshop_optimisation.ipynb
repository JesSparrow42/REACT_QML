We want to pick the best choice of items to maximise value. In this notebook, we will consider a garage that is deciding which items to order for its stores.

We want to find the best choice of items to order to get the most expecteed profit.\n",

    "In the `optimisation_intro.ipynb` notebook, we considered a simple knapsack problem endocing into a binary optimisation task where every single bit in our bit string represented whether an item was taken or not. This is quite inefficient as we need bit strings of length $m$ to solve a task with $m$ items at most to be taken. In terms of hardware, this represents simulating a time bin interferometer (PT Series) with $m/2$ photons and $m$ modes. It will quickly become hard to solve problems with lots of items.\n",

As such, we consider allocating several bits to each item, and encoding the number of copies of that item we take as a number in binary. Say we want to allow at most 15 of each item to be ordered. We can encode numbers from 0 to 15 as a bit string of length 4. So, for our three items, we can take a bit string of length (4 * 3 ) = 12, and break it up into 3 length 4 substrings, each of which encodes how many of a certain item we are ordering. For our algorithm to work well, we'd like it to be the case that if we change one bit in our string (flip a 0 to a 1), then there isn't a big change to the order that we are encoding. To achieve this, we will use 'GrayCode', which is an ordering of binary numbers such that two numbers that are next to each other only differ by one bit when encoded in binary."

For the garage, it's important to get a very good solution quickly rather than a perfect solution after a very long time.
