    "Now that we understand what the travelling salesperson problem is, we need to figure out how to pose it as a binary optimisation task. This is non-trivial, there isn't necessarily a natural choice of how to encode a path as a binary string. Say we have $n$ locations we need to visit. A first idea might be to encode a route by setting up a bit string of $n$ size $n$ blocks, and having a $1$ in space $j$ of block $i$ if we visit location $j$ at time $i$. This is of course very inefficient as we need bit strings of size $n^2$, however it does lend itself to a QUBO formulation of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll consider a maximally efficient encoding of the problem into binary, and use a non-QUBO cost function. Note that each route can be described as a permutation of the numbers from $0$ to $n-1$. There are $n!$ such permutations. So, we can correspond each bit string to one of these routes as long as we can find a function mapping bit strings to permutations. We would need length $\\lceil \\log_2(n!)\\rceil$ bit strings for this encoding. Luckily, such a function does exist, and we define it below:"

To achieve this, we penalised any solution that went over the weight capacity.
